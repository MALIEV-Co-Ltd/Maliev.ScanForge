# Initial workbench validation — 2026-10-11

This validates the implemented 0.1 foundation, not the unimplemented capabilities listed in CAPABILITIES.md.

## Executed automated checks

| Check                                                  | Result                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `git diff --check`                                     | Passed                                                                        |

The build was once refused at 1,515 MiB available RAM by the unchanged 1,536 MiB guard. It was rerun successfully when capacity returned. Other tasks were preserved. The machine's default npm shim encountered a broken global dependency; the successful npm commands used the existing Node installation's bundled `npm-cli.js` directly. No global npm repair was performed.

Geometry tests cover analytical fitting, degenerate inputs, transforms, triangle sections, closed-volume translation invariance and mesh cleanup. File tests cover STL/OBJ parsing, point-cloud rejection, project validation and exact-BREP persistence. Client tests cover serial request admission, timeouts, cancellation and worker disposal. Native smoke covers primitives, STEP/IGES/BREP roundtrips, boolean volumes, arbitrary XYZ transforms, concave polygon extrusion, invalid input, native-shape release and temporary-file cleanup.

## Browser checks

Executed through the Codex in-app browser against the compiled static build on a task-owned loopback server:

- Initial Three.js rendering, object selection and viewport fit.
- Picked point-to-point measurement: 43.425 mm on the synthetic bracket.
- Z=10 mm section: 128 segments with 152 mm total length; CSV download succeeded.
- Plane fit, displayed residuals, reference creation and undo. The undo selection regression was fixed and rechecked: the remaining scan became selected and its inspector stayed usable.
- Exact box creation: 30×30×30 mm, 27,000 mm³. STEP download succeeded.
- Project save/reopen restored the box as exact CAD; STEP export succeeded again.
- Polygon extrusion: 40×30×10 mm, 12,000 mm³.
- Box minus extrusion: 18,000 mm³. Original inputs were retained and hidden.
- Exact scale by two plus translation: 60×60×40 mm, 144,000 mm³. STEP export succeeded.
- Production offline reload succeeded under emulated network disconnection, followed by creation of a 27,000 mm³ exact CAD box from locally cached worker/WASM assets.
- No warning/error console entries observed in the checked workbench flows.
- Desktop at 1536×1024; mobile at 390×844. Mobile inspector controls were changed to one column and STL/delete actions made reachable. DOM inspection found no horizontally overflowing controls.

Offline testing covered an activated production cache. Browser update semantics can leave a new build waiting while an older tab remains open; close all old tabs to activate the next installed cache. Storage eviction and device quota remain browser-dependent.

## Design fidelity ledger

The independent full-screen concept was `exec-efaad86b-05c6-4e1e-a6ca-6d175a2c01d4.png`. The concept and desktop capture were both inspected using `view_image`. Captures are retained locally under ignored `.resources/screenshots/`; no raster screenshot is shipped as UI.

| Comparison            | Implemented evidence / intentional deviation                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layout                | Preserved header, horizontal tool strip, left explorer, light central canvas, right inspector and bottom status bar                                  |
| Palette               | Graphite navy chrome, teal selection/accent, pale gray CAD viewport; no photographic overlay                                                         |
| Typography            | Compact explicit system-font controls and a larger two-part product wordmark                                                                         |
| Component anatomy     | Thin panel separators, restrained corners, labeled numeric/vector fields, shading controls and opacity slider                                        |
| 3D scene              | Real WebGL bracket, engineering grid, camera-oriented XYZ triad. Smooth synthetic geometry intentionally replaces the concept's imaginary rough scan |
| Copy and data         | Primary action/tool labels retained. Invented concept statistics replaced by measured values; source object named “Demonstration bracket”            |
| Functional extensions | Exact modeling/sketch panels, real validation/error states and export constraints added because the workflows require them                           |
| Responsive layout     | Tool wrapping and stacked canvas/inspector below 760 px; one-column inspector below 520 px                                                           |

The shell was verified against the design direction; exact screenshot parity is not claimed. The concept's imaginary mesh texture, nested reference folders, three-axis scale fields and fake fitting statistics are intentional deviations. The implemented UI uses actual geometry/data and uniform scaling. Freeform reconstruction and certified metrology were not tested because they are not implemented.

## Remaining release boundaries

Authored source publication is in scope. Hosted website deployment and bundled binary publication are deferred pending the kernel provenance work recorded in CAD_DISTRIBUTION.md. No proprietary implementation/assets or captured sample meshes are included. No runtime CDN or geometry-upload API is used.
